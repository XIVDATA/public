## How can I help the project?

If you want to help us during development, translation, UX/UI related things, just contact us on Discord!

## Development

We use the popular PHP Framework "Laravel" for the project backend and Bootstrap in the Frontend (maybe some VueJS later too).
If you have experience in some of this and want to help us, come on our Discord or contact Syntafin directly.

## Translation

As the most things in Final Fantasy XIV, we want to bring the Database in all supported languages of the game, for the moment we support English, German, French and Japanese. Later we will add Chinese and Korean too.
Feel free to help us translate the project.

## Bug Reporting/Feedback

You found a bug or have feedback about UX/UI (User Experience/Interface)? Send them to us! You can create a Issue on our public GitHub Repository or send it in Discord (we have a example BR/Feedback Template)
